    <p>In my “Mind, Body, Spirit” project I created three unique pieces that can stand alone, but are stronger when viewed together.  This is because they are all unified by certain similar features. Some of these shared characteristics include the color palette, common images, and the collage style itself.

        When viewing the three designs next to each other it’s easy to pick up on a universal color palette.  This palette is made up of soft and light colors that can appear aged at times, with pops of bright colors in each design.  For example, in the “Mind” design the majority of the items in the picture are soft and muted except for the pop of color that can be found inside of the TV “head” in the form of a watercolor paint palette.  Another similarity in the three designs is the use of common images.  In the “Body” and “Spirit” designs I incorporated a sky.  In the “Mind” and “Spirit” designs I included a window.  Lastly, in all three of the designs I incorporated a different girl to represent me in each state.  While these designs share similar images, it’s important to note that none of these images are the same.  This results in unity across all three designs.  On a broader note, these three designs are unified by the style in which they were created.  My intention for each design was for it to look like a neat collage made of “magazine”, in this case internet, image cutouts with a hint of realism.  This is why some of the images don’t exactly look realistic such as the pink star confetti and pink heart in the “Spirit” design, while other parts do look realistic.
